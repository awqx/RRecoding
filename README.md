R Recoding: Code to import the table for guest/host affinity

##Fixed
###In 00-Download
Nothing significant.
###01-Tablebind
Nothing significant.
###02-DataCleaning
Fixed the separator so the split function would work.
Fixed the regex in the pattern so that it would detect pH across a range. 
Reformatted the code for easier reading. 

##Still Broken
###00-Download
None.
###01-TableBind
index10 and index 11 do not work
###02-DataCleaning
None

##Notes
All directories were personalized to my own folders. Further edits should probably replace it with a generic file path.
